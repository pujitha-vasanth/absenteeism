# Addressing Absenteeism At a Company During Work Time  
### Business Task
The business environment today is more competitive than it used to be. This leads to increased pressure in the work place. And so, it is reasonable to expect an increase in stress levels of the employees. This can lead to a variety of problems ranging from physical to mental illnesses. But, we will be looking at this problem from the point of view of the person responsible for improving productivity in the company.

We will explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time. In other words, we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work, based on information like:

1. How far do they live from the workplace?
2. Do they have children or pets?
3. If they do, how many?
4. Do they have a higher education degree?

This project deals with building a model that predicts an employee's absenteeism i.e. it answers the question, "will an employee be absent from work, given certain factors/considerations?"
