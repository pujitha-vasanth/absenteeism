This leads to increased pressure in the work place. And so, it is reasonable to expect an increase in stress levels of the employees. This can lead to a variety of problems ranging from physical to mental illnesses. But, we will be looking at this problem from the point of view of the person responsible for improving productivity in the company. \n","\n","We will explore whether a person presenting certain characteristics is expected to be away from work at some point in time. In other words, we want to know for how many working hours an employee could be away from work, based on information like:\n","\n","1. How far do they live from the workplace? \n","2. Do they have children or pets? \n","3. If they do, how many?\n","4. Do they have a higher education degree?\n","\n","We'd build a model that predicts an employee's absenteeism i.e. will an employee be absent from work, given certain factors/considerations?\n","\n","# The Dataset\n","The Absenteeism-data.csv is a dataset based on an existing study about absenteeism in a work place. It contains information regarding the employee ID, Reason for Absense, Transportation Expense, Distance to Work, Age, Daily Work Load Average, Body Mass Index, Education, Children, Pets, and Absenteeism Time (Hours). \n","\n","The relevant libraries are imported, the raw data is loaded using the pandas library, and a copy is made to keep the orignial dataset unharmed.
